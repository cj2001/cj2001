### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Clair Sullivan and I am a Machine Learning Engineer at GitHub!  You can find my [resume, speaker bio, etc. here](https://github.com/cj2001/my_resume) (as one of my pinned repos). In addition to my work at GitHub, I am also the CEO of [La Neige Analytics](https://www.laneige-analytics.com/), which is a consulting firm dedicated to helping ski areas improve their revenue (and maybe other things!) by helping analyze their existing data and creating new data collection strategies.  I am a 100% remote worker and have been for several years before COVID-19.  I love where I live in the mountains of Colorado and have no interest in moving! 

My major professional interests and some areas I have worked on while at GitHub:

- General machine learning and data science 
- Graph analytics (I love [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)), including ML on graphs
- Natural language processing
- Python, SQL, Spark, R (I am just learning that one)
- Various cloud environments, most notably AWS and Azure

I am working to add various samples of my code, so this list will grow with time.  As of right now:

- A Jupyter notebook ML exploration of [Twitter bot detection](https://github.com/cj2001/twitter_bot_detection_sample/blob/main/twitter_bot_detection_demo.ipynb)

In addition to my work at GitHub, I also have the following interests:

- Internet of Things
- Satellite imagery analysis and GIS
- Skiing
