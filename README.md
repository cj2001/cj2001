My name is Dr. Clair Sullivan and I am the Founder and CEO of a freelance data science consulting company, [Clair Sullivan and Associates, LLC](https://clairsullivan.com).  You can find my [resume, speaker bio, etc. here](https://github.com/cj2001/my_resume) (as one of my pinned repos). My most recent past roles include the Director of Data Science at Vail Resorts, Data Science Advocate at Neo4j, and Machine Learning Engineer at GitHub.  I am a 100% remote worker and have been for several years before COVID-19.  I love where I live in the mountains of Colorado and have no interest in moving!

I also have returned to school at the University of Wisconsin to work on my MBA.  Degree number 5...very excited!
