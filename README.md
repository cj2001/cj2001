# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dr. Clair Sullivan and I am a Graph Data Science Advocate at Neo4j!  You can find my [resume, speaker bio, etc. here](https://github.com/cj2001/my_resume) (as one of my pinned repos). In addition to my work at Neo4j, I am also the CEO of [La Neige Analytics](https://www.laneige-analytics.com/), which is a consulting firm dedicated to helping ski areas improve their revenue (and maybe other things!) by helping analyze their existing data and creating new data collection strategies.  I am a 100% remote worker and have been for several years before COVID-19.  I love where I live in the mountains of Colorado and have no interest in moving!
